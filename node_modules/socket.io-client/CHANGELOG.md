# [2.4.0](https://github.com/Automattic/socket.io-client/compare/2.3.1...2.4.0) (2021-01-04)

The minor bump is matching the bump of the server, but there is no new feature in this release.


## [2.3.1](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/compare/2.3.0...2.3.1) (2020-09-30)

The `debug` dependency has been reverted to `~3.1.0`, as the newer versions contains ES6 syntax which breaks in IE
browsers.

Please note that this only applied to users that bundle the Socket.IO client in their application, with webpack for
example, as the "official" bundles (in the dist/ folder) were already transpiled with babel.

For webpack users, you can also take a look at the [webpack-remove-debug](https://github.com/johngodley/webpack-remove-debug)
plugin.
